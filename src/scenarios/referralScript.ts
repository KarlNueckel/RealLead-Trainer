export const referralScriptContent = `Hi [Name], this is [Agent] with [Company].
[Referring Agent’s Name] mentioned you might be considering selling your property, so I wanted to personally reach out and introduce myself. How are you doing today?

$

That’s great! So tell me a little about the property—what are you thinking in terms of price, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and any updates or repairs you’ve made or might need?


$

Got it. And what’s motivating the possible move—are you looking to move locally or out of the area?

$

Perfect, thank you for sharing that. Every seller has different needs, so I always like to ask—what are you looking for in a real estate agent? How can I best help you through this process?


$

Based on what you’ve told me, I’d love to meet with you for a quick listing consultation—it’s a short meeting where I can walk you through your home’s current market value, what buyers are paying in your area, and the best strategy to get your price.
I have [Day, Time] or [Day, Time] available—what works better for you?

$

Awesome, I’m looking forward to meeting you. I’ll send you a quick confirmation and a few prep tips before we meet—sound good?`;
